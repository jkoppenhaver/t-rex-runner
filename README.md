## Modified T-Rex Game from Chromium
This is the t-rex game from chromium that is shown when there is no internet.  This game has been modified to score based on the number of times you duck instead of the distance.

The game is hosted on this [project's site](https://jkoppenhaver.github.io/t-rex-runner/)

see the [source](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/neterror/resources/offline.js?q=t-rex+package:%5Echromium$&dr=C&l=7) from chromium
